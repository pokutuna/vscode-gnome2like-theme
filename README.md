# vscode-gnome2like-theme

![Gnome2Like Theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pokutuna/vscode-gnome2like-theme/main/images/screenshot.png)


A VS Code color theme based on the `color-theme-gnome2` from Emacs color-theme.el package.  
I added more colors to fit VSCode's requirements while keeping the original theme look and feel.
